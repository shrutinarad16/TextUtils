## 💬 HR & CEO Note

This project is not just a React demo—it's a showcase of clean code, scalable UI patterns, and real-world utility development.  
It reflects not only my grasp of modern front-end tech but also user-first design thinking, modular architecture, and attention to UI/UX detail.

I'm excited to bring this same dedication to your organization.
